	<p>For example, rates of depression between 12% and 59%<br>
	and anxiety between 30% and 50% have been reported in<br>
	samples of caregivers, in comparison to those of<br>
	depression between 10% and 25% and between 19% and<br>
	34% in the patient population. Additionally, between 40%<br>
	and 76% of cancer caregivers reported clinically significant<br>
	symptoms of insomnia, which negatively affect their<br>
	mental and physical health, are frequently chronic, and<br>
	may impair the normal grieving process among bereaved<br>
	caregivers. These symptoms can increase the risk for<br>
	chronic illness in caregivers, including cardiovascular<br>
	disease and <a href="mom-08.html">cancer.</a>
