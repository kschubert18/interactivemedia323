	<p>This uncompensated care involves significant time and<br>
	energy as well as requires performing tasks that are<br>
	physically, emotionally, socially, and existentially<br>
	demanding. Indeed, caregivers are at risk for psychological<br>
	(eg, anxiety, depression, and hopelessness) and physical<br>
	(eg, increased mortality, cardiovascular disease, poor<br>
	immune functioning, and sleep difficulties) complications.<br>
	Although some studies of caregivers reported comparable<br>
	rates of depression and anxiety to those of patients for<br>
	whom they provide care, others have shown rates that<br>
	<a href="b-26.html">surpass those of patients</a>.
