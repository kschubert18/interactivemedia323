	<h3>
	  <span><em>Hope</em> is the thing with feathers
	  That perches in the soul,
	  <em>And sings the tune without the words,
	  And never stops at all,</em>
	  And sweetest in the gale is heard;
	  And sore must be the storm
	  That could abash the little bird
	  That kept so many warm.
	  I've heard it in the chillest land,
	  And on the strangest sea;
	  Yet, never, in extremity,
	  <em>It asked a crumb of me.</em></span>
