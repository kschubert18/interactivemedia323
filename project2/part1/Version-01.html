	<p>
	  Hope is the thing with feathers<br>
	  That perches in the soul,<br>
	  And sings the tune without the words,<br>
	  And never stops at all,<br><br>
	  And sweetest in the gale is heard;<br>
	  And sore must be the storm<br>
	  That could abash the little bird<br>
	  That kept so many warm.<br><br>
	  I've heard it in the chillest land,<br>
	  And on the strangest sea;<br>
	  Yet, never, in extremity,<br>
	  It asked a crumb of me.<br><br><br><br>
