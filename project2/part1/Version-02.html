	  Hope is the thing with feathers &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
	  That perches in the soul, &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
	  And sings the tune without the words,&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
	  And never stops at all, <br><br><br><br><br><br>
	  And sweetest in the gale is heard; &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
	  And sore must be the storm &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
	  That could abash the little bird &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
	  That kept so many warm.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
	  I've heard it in the chillest land, &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
	  And on the strangest sea; &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
	  Yet, never, in extremity, &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
	  It asked a crumb of me.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
